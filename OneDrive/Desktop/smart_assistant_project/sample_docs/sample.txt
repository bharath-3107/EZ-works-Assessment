Artificial Intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines. 
These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction. AI is used in various industries 
including healthcare, finance, education, and transportation.

Modern AI systems can analyze vast datasets, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that deals with the interaction between computers and humans through language.

Research in AI continues to expand in areas such as reinforcement learning, computer vision, and generative models.
